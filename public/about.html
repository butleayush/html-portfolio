<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey!, I'm Ayush — on a mission to become a full-stack web developer, and I'm
  going all-in with a single, intensive bootcamp that covers everything from
  basics to cutting-edge tech. No fluff, just straight-up building real projects
  that actually work. Right now, I'm mastering the full modern stack: Frontend:
  HTML5, CSS3 (with responsive design & animations), JavaScript (ES6+,
  async/await, DOM manipulation), and React (components, hooks, state
  management, routing with React Router) Backend: Node.js & Express for servers,
  APIs, authentication, middleware, and handling requests like a pro Database:
  PostgreSQL for relational data—queries, joins, migrations, and connecting it
  all securely Next-level stuff: Web3 fundamentals, blockchain integration,
  smart contracts basics, and building decentralized applications (DApps) with
  wallets, Ethereum tools, and on-chain interactions The best part? It's 100%
  project-driven. I've already shipped things like: Responsive landing pages and
  multi-page sites Interactive games and dynamic UIs Full CRUD apps with user
  auth and real backend logic API integrations and database-powered dashboards
  Early experiments with Web3 features like connecting wallets and simple DApps
  I'm obsessed with clean code, user experience, performance, and solving real
  problems through tech. Always tinkering, debugging late, and learning
  something new every day. Super open to feedback, collaborations, open-source
  contributions, or just chatting about code, Web3 trends, or why dark mode is
  superior 😄 If you're hiring, building something cool, or want to pair-program
  a feature—hit me up! Let's create some awesome web experiences together.
  🚀💻🔗 Feel free to plug in your name, add specific project names/examples
  from your work (e.g., "my task manager app with PostgreSQL backend" or "a
  basic NFT viewer DApp"), tweak the tone, or shorten sections. If you'd like
  visuals sprinkled in (like code screenshots or stack icons), or want me to
  adjust the length further, just say the word! Keep crushing it—you're building
  a killer skill set.
