<h1>The Best Movies According to Ayush</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>God Father</h3>
<p>
  Just rewatched The Godfather and wow—it still holds up perfectly. The way it
  makes you root for (or at least understand) a family of criminals is
  brilliant. Brando mumbles his way into legend status, Pacino goes from war
  hero to cold-blooded boss like it’s nothing, and that ending door slam…
  chills. Slow burn that pays off massively. Timeless classic. Highly recommend.

<h3>The machinist</h3>
<p>
  Christian Bale's physical commitment is insane; he looks like a walking ghost,
  which amps up the paranoia and isolation perfectly. The washed-out colors and
  industrial gloom create this suffocating vibe, and the story's slow reveal
  about what really broke Trevor is devastating. It's dark, unsettling, and
  sticks with you. If you like mind-benders like Memento or Jacob's Ladder, this
  one's essential viewing.
</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
  Fight Club holds up insanely well—dark, funny, chaotic, and uncomfortably
  relevant. Pitt owns every scene as Tyler, Norton’s unraveling is gripping, and
  that final shot? Chef’s kiss. It’s not just a movie; it’s a middle finger to
  everything boring. Still slaps.
